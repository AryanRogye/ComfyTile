# ComfyTile
Currently my daily driver for last 3 months, I've been fixing bugs on the way,

ComfyTile is a macOS window manager inspired by Rectangle, Alt-Tab, DockDoor, and Aerospace, focused on center tiling, window nudging, and advanced multi-monitor layouts—with fast window switching and previews built in.

### Multi-Monitor Support (Tested)
ComfyTile has been extensively tested on **multi-monitor setups**, including displays with:
- Different resolutions and scaling factors
- Mixed horizontal and vertical arrangements
- Non-zero and negative coordinate origins
