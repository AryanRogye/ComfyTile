These files contain symbol listings generated via `nm` from the macOS dyld shared cache.
No Apple binaries, frameworks, or source code are included.
The listings consist only of symbol names and addresses.
Used for research, debugging, and compatibility analysis.

They are kept in this repository to avoid re-running `nm` during development
and to serve as a reference for research, debugging, and compatibility analysis.
